    // for example, through MPI, then you don't need to modify this application
    // to use multiple devices. Just run one instance per each device.

    // and want to utilize multi-card Xeon Phi machine -- in this case you
    // will not need to do any adjustments in work partitioning because
    // all cards have the same compute power and simple approach used here
    // (with evenly devided work among all devices) should work well.

    // For this sample scenario, user should limit number of devices for each
    // application instance externally. It can be:
    //     - setting -t command line option with different values depending on
    //       application instance, so different application instances will use
    //       different types of devices (e.g. CPU+ACC, CPU+GPU);
    //     - environment variable OFFLOAD_DEVICES (Xeon Phi device only) in
    //       multi-card Xeon Phi environment;
    //     - the combination of two above (e.g. CPU + several accelerators).

    // Here we just pick the first device available of specified type and
    // run regular non-multi-device scenario on it. The only thing that
